## Required packages to run the Python Jupyter notebook

Obviously this project is not so magnificient that you need extreme versions of python libraries for it to run. But just for formalties,
these are the python libraries and their versions which I have used for running this program in a Kaggle notebook

pandas == 2.2.3
numpy == 1.26.4
