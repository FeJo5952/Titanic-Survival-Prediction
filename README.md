# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project aims to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning. It is based on the Kaggle competition ["Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

This is my first ML project which I ever made, so be a bit lenient in judging me. But feel free to provide your suggestions.

## 🧠 Model
- **Algorithm Used:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Initial Score:** ~0.70 accuracy on Kaggle public leaderboard

---

## 📊 Features Used
- Pclass
- Sex (one-hot encoded)
- SibSp
- Parch
- Fare (filled 1 missing value in test_data with mode)

---

## 🔧 Future Improvements
- Add missing `Age` values using imputation (Age is obviously important)
- Try other models like XGBoost or Logistic Regression
- Hyperparameter tuning

---

## 📁 Files
- `titanic-ml-competition.ipynb`: Code and model
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the notebook
